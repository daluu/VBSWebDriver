# VBSWebDriver

This is a clone/fork of http://htejera.users.sourceforge.net/vbswebdriver, until the original project resumes updates, etc. Also forked this for reasons of better community collaboration and forking should others like to contribute.

Also note other alternatives to this project like https://github.com/florentbr/SeleniumBasic and https://github.com/daluu/seleniumexceladdin, however, this project provides a native VBScript (plus native Windows libraries) solution that may be simpler when you don't need the extras of VBA or ActiveX/COM.
